# Making of @fantox01/lyrics-scraper

## How?

- Using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) and [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio)
- **Axios -** A promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- **Cheerio -** A fast, flexible, and elegant library for parsing and manipulating HTML and XML.

## Why?

- IDK, scraping is fun to me and also legal upto a limited extend as long as you don't misuse it.
